    "The Newton-Raphson method works as follows:\n",
    "1. We start by defining some variables in our model; tol, epsilon, count, max_iter and sigma. The tolerance for the implied volatility is the maximum amount the implied volatility is allowed to be off by. Epsilon is the measure of the difference between the new and old values, which is calculated in the following line of code `epsilon = abs((sigma - orig_vol)/sigma)`. `count` and `max_iter` are variables which allow us to keep track how many times the loop has executed, `max_iter` is important as it acts as a breaking point as to which the code will stop running. Finally, `sigma` represents our starting value for our volatility.\n",
    "2. The model now starts the while loop.\n",
    "3. The code runs the `d()` function once in every loop, calculating and returning the `d1` and `d2` variables.\n",
    "4. The code then runs the `call_price` function, which runs the Black-Scholes equations returning the `price` for the call option.\n",
    "5. Computes `vega` which is the derivative of the price with respect to the change in volatility.\n",
    "6. Updates the value of `sigma`.\n",
    "7. Computes the new value of `epsilon`, which is the difference between the `orig_sigma` and `sigma`.\n",
    "8. When either the epsilon value is smaller than the tolerance, or the maximum number of iterations the code stops running. If the epsilon value is smaller than the tolerance, the volatility and number of iterations is printed. Otherwise the breaking count is printed."
