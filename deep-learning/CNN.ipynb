    "### Layers in our CNN:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Conv2D:\n",
    "   - This layer takes an input image and creates a filter (convolutional kernel).\n",
    "   - The filter slides across the image, taking a 3x3 matrix of pixels.\n",
    "   - It multiplies the filter's values by the corresponding pixel values and generates the dot product.\n",
    "   - The dot product is saved in our feature map, which is passed to the next hidden layer.\n",
    "   - This filter helps the network recognize specific patterns and features in the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. MaxPooling2D:\n",
    "   - This layer downsamples the data while retaining the most important information.\n",
    "   - It slides a small matrix (usually a 2x2 matrix) across the feature map.\n",
    "   - At each position, it takes the maximum value within that window.\n",
    "   - The maximum value is then kept, and the rest of the values are discarded.\n",
    "   - This process generates a new downsampled feature map with reduced dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Flatten:\n",
    "   - The flatten layer is used to reduce the dimensions from a 2D feature map to a 1D vector.\n",
    "   - This allows the two-dimensional data to be converted into other formats and passed through other hidden layers.\n",
    "   - It takes the input of the 2-dimensional feature map and rearranges the data by stacking the values on 1 dimension.\n",
    "   - The output is a 1-dimensional vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Dense:\n",
    "   - This layer is used to understand the complex patterns in the data.\n",
    "   - It does this through the weights and biases stored by the neurons.\n",
    "   - The weighted sums pass through an activation function, determining whether the output is passed to the next layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activation Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "The final layer of our CNN uses the `softmax` function instead of the `relu` function. The `softmax` function transforms the data into a matrix representing the probabilities that the neural network has calculated for the different outcomes."
