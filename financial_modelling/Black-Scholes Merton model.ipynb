    "The Black-Scholes Merton model is a mathematical formula used to calculate the theoretical price of European call and put options, using various input parameters such as the current stock price, strike price, time to expiration, risk-free interest rate, and implied volatility. It is a widely used tool in finance for option pricing and has been instrumental in the development of the options market.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will be implementing the Black-Scholes Merton model in Python. We will start by discussing the assumptions behind the model, followed by an explanation of the formula used to calculate option prices. We will then show how to implement the model in Python using the NumPy and SciPy libraries, and provide an example of how to use the model to price a call option."

It has been found that (implicit) volatility patterns take many graphical forms, most observed being “volatility smiles”, “smirks” and “skews”.
