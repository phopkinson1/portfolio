    "Bonds are a key financial instrument that are widely used in financial markets as a means to raise capital, they are commonly used by firms and governments. The price of a bond is the present value of the future cash flows, and is therefore sensitive to changes in interest rates. In this project, we will start by looking at bond types and bond ratings, then we will show the code for how to calculate the bond price and duration."

    "* Government bonds - these are issued by governments and are considered to be the safest types of bonds.\n",

    "* Municipal bonds - these are issued by state and local governments to fund public infrastructure, such as schools, highways and hospitals.\n",
    "* High-yield bonds - these are also known as junk bonds, they are issued by companies with a higher risk of default. They offer higher yields to compensate for the additional risk.\n",
    "* Convertible bonds - these are bonds which allow investors to convert bonds into a predetermined number of shares of the issuer's stock.\n",
    "* Callable bonds - these allow the issuer to redeem the bonds before the maturity, typically at a premium price.\n",
    "* Zero-coupon bonds - these are bonds which do not pay any interest but are sold at a discount to their face value. The return is the difference between the purchase price and the face value.\n",
    "* Floating-rate bonds: These have a variable interest rate that is tied to a benchmark rate such as LIBOR. The interest rate is adjusted periodically to reflect changes in the benchmark rate.\n",

For bonds with these factors, we would need to consider alternative models.*"
